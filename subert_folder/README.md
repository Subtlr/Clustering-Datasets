Hello, welcome to the folder full of my attempts on clustering the datasets provided by this repository!

## 1. 🧠 Banknote Authentication with Gaussian Mixture Models ([banknote_sW.ipynb](https://github.com/Subtlr/Clustering-Datasets/blob/master/subert_folder/banknote_sW.ipynb))

This notebook explores unsupervised clustering techniques on the [Banknote Authentication dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).  
The goal was to distinguish between forged and genuine banknotes using statistical features — without using the labels during training.

### 🚀 Project Highlights

- Engineered features like `skewness + kurtosis` and `variance` for better separability
- Benchmarked 2 clustering models, HDBSCAN and GMM
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) achieved the best performance with an NMI of **0.8692**
- Visualized Gaussian ellipses to interpret cluster shapes and confidence

### 🏆 GMM Clustering Results
